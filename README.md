# CSES Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). This repository contains my personal solutions to the problems provided by the CSES (Computer Science Education Society) platform. The CSES Problem Set is an excellent collection of competitive programming problems designed to enhance your problem-solving and coding skills.

## Introduction

The CSES Problem Set consists of a variety of algorithmic challenges ranging from introductory problems to more advanced topics. This repository is a way for me to document my progress and share my solutions with others.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the categories of problems in the CSES Problem Set. Each folder contains the respective solutions for the problems in that category.

├── Introductory Problems
│ ├── ReadMe.md
│ ├── ...
│ ├── ...
│ └── ...
├── Sorting And Searching
│ ├── ReadMe.md
│ ├── ...
│ ├── ...
│ └── ...
├── Dynamic Programming
│ ├── ReadMe.md
│ ├── ...
│ ├── ...
│ └── ...
└── ...

Each Solution file is named according to the problem name.


## Languages Used

I have used only C++ as the programming languages to solve the problems.


## Solutions

Here is a list of the problem categories and their corresponding solutions:

- **Introductory Problems** 
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Range Queries** (solutions for this haven't been added yet)
- **Tree Algorithms**
- **Mathematics** (solutions for this haven't been added yet)
- **String Algorithms** (solutions for this haven't been added yet)
- **Geometry**
- **Advanced Techniques** (solutions for this haven't been added yet)

Each category has its own `ReadMe.md` file detailing the solutions included in that folder.

## Usage

This repository serves as a personal record of your problem-solving journey and may not be directly executable. Here's a general approach to using these solutions:

1. **Access the CSES Problem Set:** Visit [https://cses.fi/](https://cses.fi/) to explore the problems.
2. **Choose a problem:** Select a problem from a specific section and understand its requirements.
3. **Review the solution (optional):** You can review the provided solution code in the corresponding directory here to understand different approaches.
4. **Implement your own solution:** Write your own C++ code to solve the problem based on your understanding.
5. **Test and refine:** Test your code with the provided test cases on the CSES platform and refine your solution as needed.

**Note:** While reviewing existing solutions can be helpful, strive to develop your own problem-solving skills and approach each problem with a fresh perspective.
